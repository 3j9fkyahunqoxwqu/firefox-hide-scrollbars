# Hide Scrollbars in Firefox

Hide scrollbars in Firefox while still being able to scroll!

## Known Issues

-   doesn't work with any other scrolling related addons
-   some sites will become unresponsive to scroll events
-   some images/other media files will not display properly when viewing them in their own tab

## Solutions

Don't use hide scrollbars if you rely on another scrolling related extension.  Although hide scrollbars works on most sites, some sites will be unresponsive or display improperly.  To fix this simply click "show" in the hide scrollbars menu and reload the page.

## Donate

If you would like to sponsor making this extension better please donate.  Otherwise, I am done working on this addon.

### $10 Goal

Fix problems with files when viewed in separate tabs

### $20 Goal

I will create a blacklist for sites so you don't have to keep enabling/disabling the extension on sites the hide scrollbars doesn't work on.

### $50 Goal

I will make a auto-hide scroll bar similar to the one in firefox on macOS.
